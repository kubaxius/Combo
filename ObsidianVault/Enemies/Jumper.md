Guy in exosuit, jumps onto the worm and grabs it, and slowly attacks it. 

Main way to remove him is to scrub him into the ground - harder ground means more damage, and you can get rid of him faster.

You can also kill him with guns, or electroshield. Normal shield protects against him grabbing you.
